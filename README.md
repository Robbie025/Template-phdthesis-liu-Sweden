Description:

This is a template for writing a PhD thesis at Link√∂ping Univesity or any other university in Sweden. The styling is derived heavily from classicthesis, which is simple and easily readable. I have made some changes to the original style includeing page size, colours, margin etc. The orginal is much more comprehensive and I can recommend the reader to have a look at it.

Page size: S5

Additionally, I have also added a template for spikblad as well as template for the appended articles. Not everything is automated. The user needs to compile the PhD thesis, spikblad and the appended articles separately.
